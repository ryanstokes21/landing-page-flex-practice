# landing-page-flex-practice

This is a landing page project to work on using flexbox to structure the website.

Using max widths and margin auto helps move content more to the center of the page. That gives that nice padding look on the left and right side while also being responsive when resizing the screen.

Used a little margin on the top or bottom of element to have spacing between one another.
